# Amazon Store Database 

## Overview 
This project involved building a Java-based user interface and a SQL database structure. Here, I connected to a PostgreSQL database and run SQL queries, as well as load supplied data records into my database. The application allows functions like user registration, login/logout, product browsing and ordering, and product information updating in order to serve non-SQL users, notably customers and managers of the Amazon Store.
